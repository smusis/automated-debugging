I suggest you collaborate with some one in the social sciences that has expertise in constructing surveys that will get unbiased results.  I am over all highly skeptical and suspect that it is impossible to create an automated debugger that will save me time over all. It will probably work well in simple cases where it isn't needed and fall on its face and generate false positives in hard cases where it is actually needed.  I work primarily in python these days so my views are skewed to dynamically typed languages. Something like this will probably have better success in a strongly typed language like c/c++ but then you have access to very low level memory and the full complexity of c++.

Open source bug reports are often not bugs at all. Usually are often unsure of whether the results are a bug or ""they are just doing it wrong"". Often when a user is confident their claim represents a bug they don't include all the information required to reproduce it.  This could be a working test, steps to reproduce, conditions the error took place (platform, version) etc.   Having an automated tool would be useful to not only locate the source of a bug, but to evaluate the original claim of a bugs existence. Having a tool automatically confirm a bug (and perhaps where to look to fix it) would easily convince a maintainer that this bug report is worth looking at.  Considering my project has several hundred open issues (and several thousand closed ones) this distinction would make it easier to distinguish between good and bad bug reports and work much quicker."

The question is: What class of errors can be discovered by automated debugging? If it's reference errors, SEGV, etc, then we have garbage collection to solve that. We also have visualvm, YJP ,etc. If it's type errors, then we have strict typed compilers, as required for the job (Java, Spark, Coq, etc). A lot of automated debugging can be done by putting assertions into code, as modern processors can frequently evaluate an assertion on registers faster than they can read memory. If we're going to be purely statistical rather than analytic, then there's always gatech tarantula - your questions above make me wonder whether you are going to reinvent tarantula. The questions above suggest that (a) I need to construct a failing test to find this result, and (b) that unit test did not ALREADY localize the bug - remember, it's a unit test.  I worry that you're only left with mathematical/structural errors in code, (mis)application of design patterns, etc, which are clearly beyond the scope of automated diagnosis.  My daily codebase is 500K LoC. Anything smaller than 30K barely needs tooling - you can write 30K lines fairly successfully even in python or perl.  The most useful tools to me at the moment are static analysis tools. Stricter compilers, abstract interpretation, better type systems, dataflow analysis, etc. None of these are driven from test failures - abstract interpretation is much more powerful than test.  You should integrate with gradle. Forget the IDEs. When you have a large number of developers and a CI system, the point of contact with test failures is NOT the IDE."
